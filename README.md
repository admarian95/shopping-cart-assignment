1. The following assignment is made as a SPA and some features maybe missing as of now due to the compexity mainly because I've never done SPA in pure JS only.. and due to the time constraints as well.

2. To run the code 1st do npm i --save in terminal

4. open two more terminals , 
5. in the first one run node index.js to run the node server
